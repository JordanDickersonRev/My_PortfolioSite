    summary : `SkateHouse is a mock up e-commerce application 
        where users can buy complete skateboards. Upon entering
        the application, the user will land on the home page which
        consist of six links (store, enter the raffle, Twitter,
        Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat). The header of the application 
        has five links (log in, sign up, home, store, bag). The 
        store page has a collection of complete skateboards that the 
        user can pick from. If the user is looking for a particular 
        skateboard size, the store has six sizes that they can look 
        through. When clicking on a skateboard, the user will be taken 
        to that specific skateboard page where they can do four things 
        (specify how many boards they want to order, check if the skateboard
        is left in stock, add it to their bag, view a bigger picture
        of the skateboard). The users bag shows every skateboard that they 
        added, the total due, and a list of their favorite skateboards if 
        the user is logged in. Users can also add skateboards to the bag
        from their favorites. Scroll down to the foresight section for
        my future plans.`,
