    summary :`SkateHouse is a mock up e-commerce website where 
        clients can buy complete skateboards. Upon entering, the 
        client will land on the home page which consist of six links, 
        store, enter the raffle, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and 
        Snapchat. The header of the website 
        has five links, log in, sign up, home, store, and bag. The 
        store page has a collection of complete skateboards that the 
        clients can pick from. If the client is looking for a particular 
        skateboard size, the store has six sizes that they can look 
        through. When clicking on a skateboard, the client will be taken 
        to that specific skateboard page where they can do four things, 
        specify how many boards they want to order, check if the skateboard
        is left in stock, add it to their bag, and view a bigger picture
        of the skateboard. The client's bag shows every skateboard that they 
        added, the total due, and a list of their favorite skateboards if 
        the client is logged in. Clients can also add skateboards to the bag
        from their favorites. Scroll down to see my future plans for this
        website.`,
