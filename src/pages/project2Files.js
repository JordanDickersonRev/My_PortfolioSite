    summary : `\tAMD & Intel Web Scraper is an application that takes the
        best rated desktops and laptops from AMD and Intel to display
        that information for the user to see. The header includes a 
        link to the home page with a hamburger menu that contains four
        links (AMD laptops, AMD desktops, Intel laptops, Intel desktops).
        The home page has two links, AMD and Intel. Each link shows the
        best rated laptops and desktops put together for said brand. 
        When viewing any link in the application the user can see the 
        description of the product and the website it came from. Upon 
        clicking on the description, the user will be redirected to the 
        product itself. Currently, this application only scrapes from
        best buy but the goal is to add more websites. Scroll down to see 
        my future plans for this application.`,
